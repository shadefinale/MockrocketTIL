[MockrocketTIL](http://til-shadefinale.rhcloud.com/) is a clone of the [Hashrocket TIL microblog](http://til.hashrocket.com), and attempts to recreate the functionality of the site.

The application is fully test-driven and written in Ruby on Rails.

In addition, you can view a series of blog posts [here](http://www.donaldkelsey.com/blog/mockrockettil-table-of-contents) to see how exactly the application was built out.

Finally, if you'd like to follow along with the blog posts and build this application yourself, you can view the projects on [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1461798)!
